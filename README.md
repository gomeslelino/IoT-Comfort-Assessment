# IoT-Comfort-Assessment
This Project combines IoT sensor principles with Data Science and Analytics through Machine Learning.

Sensors measuring  temperature,  humidity,  loudness  and  dust  particles were installed in a TUM lecture room, as well as a voting box asking users of the room if they feel comfortable or not. Data about the sensor readings and the public comfort perception were collected for one month (mid July to mid August 2023). A  random forest regressor  model was then used on the resulting database in order to determine the optimal conditions for comfort, as well as which factors influence people's perception of comfort the most.
